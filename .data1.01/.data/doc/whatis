RaspBoy is a bash script that creates an interactive interface that uses gamepads for script selections. 
As a personw ith big thumbs, and lack of appeal to carry around a keyboard everywhere with my raspi, I decided to make gamepads functional. 
Now you can use your controllers to  hack in walk in confort!
